# ft_printf

*"This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects."*

### Subject and goal:
*'You will discover a popular and versatile C function: printf(). This exercise is a great
opportunity to improve your programming skills. It is of moderate difficulty. You will discover variadic functions in C.
The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and extensible code.'*

### Skills that I've learned / improved
- Working with a variadic functions
- Using va_list, va_start, va_arg & va_end.
- Working with arrays (assigning memory and copying from and to arrays)
- Working with hexidecial numbers
