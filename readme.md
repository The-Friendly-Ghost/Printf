*"This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions."*

### Subject and goal:
*'You will discover a popular and versatile C function: printf(). This exercise is a great
opportunity to improve your programming skills. It is of moderate difficulty. You will discover variadic functions in C.
The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and extensible code.'*

### Skills that I've learned / improved
- Working with a variadic functions
- Using va_list, va_start, va_arg & va_end.
- Working with arrays (assigning memory and copying from and to arrays)
- Working with hexidecial numbers
